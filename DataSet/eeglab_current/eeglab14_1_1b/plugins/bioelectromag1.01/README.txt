This plugin aims at using one of the functionality of the 
EEG toolbox, a toolbox which is no longer supported since 2006.

Only functions necessary to perform these functions are
included in the folder bioelectromagnetism_list.

However, to get the full functionalities of the EEG
toolbox, you may download the full bioelectromagnetism 
distribution at
