All experiments were performed using facilities at:
RIKEN, Brain Science Institute, Laboratory for Advanced Brain Signal Processing
===================



EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:

EEG system: 128-channel BIOSEMI (active electrodes, see http://www.biosemi.com for cap layout)
Sampling rate: 256 Hz
Monitor vertical refresh rate: 170 Hz
Eye-monitor distance: ~90 cm

15 seconds of SSVEP available for 4 subjects.
     |---------------|
-----|    SSVEP      |----- 
The SSVEP ONSET  point is at second  5 from beginning of the data.
The SSVEP OFFSET point is at second 20 from beginning of the data.

3 SSVEP stimulation frequencies available (8 Hz, 14 Hz, 28 Hz). 
See corresponding text files for the precise frequencies (very small deviations).

6 trials available for each SSVEP frequency.
